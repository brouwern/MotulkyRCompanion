# Introduction

The goal of the book is to provide R code that allows readers to 

1. Implement in R the statistical analyses found in Harvey Motulsky's *Intuitive Biostatistics, 2nd edition* (IB)
2. Use R to create publication-quality recreations of key figures found in the book.

This guide began as project for graduate students in the Department of Biological Sciences at Duquense University.

Currently, the following chapters from the 2nd edition of IB are covered in this guide

* 2-sample t-test
* Paired t-test
